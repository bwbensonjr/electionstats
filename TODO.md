# Changes to make for this project

- ~~Modify `query_elections` to take strings for an `office` parameter, rather than an `office_id` that needs to be looked up.~~
- ~~Factor out base URL.~~
- Add unit tests.
- ~~Change incumbent_status from a -1, 0, 1 integer to a string factor~~
- Document query_elections and return columns in README.md.
